# Development Guide

You can use [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/) to create an isolated workspace that doesn't depend on system-wide ROS installations or external colcon build/install directories.

Install Pixi first by following [its official documentation](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/installation/).

## Prerequisites

The following must be installed system-wide.
See [README.md](../README.md) for installation instructions:

_Dependent repos_: Installed via `vcs import external < pai.repos --recursive`

_GPU drivers (optional)_: For GPU acceleration, install the appropriate drivers for your hardware:

- **NVIDIA**: NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit for CUDA-based acceleration
- **Intel**: Intel GPU drivers for XPU-based acceleration on iGPU or discrete Intel Arc GPUs
- If no GPU drivers are present, the system will fall back to CPU-based inference (slower)

ROS 2 Lyrical dependencies are automatically installed via Pixi when you run `pixi install`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Development Environment

Install base environment and ML dependencies:

```bash
# Step 1: Install base environment (includes ROS 2 Lyrical dependencies)
pixi install

# Step 2: Install ML dependencies (automatically detects GPU and installs appropriate PyTorch)
pixi run install-ml-deps
```

The `install-ml-deps` task automatically:

- Detects your GPU (NVIDIA CUDA, Intel XPU iGPU/Arc, or CPU fallback)
- Installs the appropriate PyTorch version

### 2. Build

Build the workspace directly from the repository root folder:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository root (where pixi.toml is located)
cd demos

# Build the workspace using Pixi task
pixi run build
```

### 3. Run Demo

The workspace is configured to use Zenoh middleware automatically.
The `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION` environment variable is set to `rmw_zenoh_cpp` via the Pixi activation environment.

Before running any ROS 2 commands, start the Zenoh router in a separate terminal.

Terminal 1 (start Zenoh router):

```bash
pixi run zenoh-router
```

Terminal 2 (launch Gazebo simulation):

```bash
pixi run so-arm-gz
```

MuJoCo simulation (SO-ARM in MuJoCo):

```bash
pixi run so-arm-mujoco
```

### 4. Interactive Mode with Pixi Shell

For interactive development, you can use `pixi shell` to enter an interactive shell with the environment activated.

```bash
cd demos
pixi shell
```

Once in the shell, the ROS environment is automatically sourced and `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp` is set.
You can run commands (e.g., `colcon build`, Python scripts) directly.
This is useful for interactive debugging, testing, and running multiple commands.

Note: When running ROS 2 commands manually in the shell, ensure the Zenoh router is running.
Start it in a separate terminal using `pixi run zenoh-router`.

Additional resources for using Pixi can be found at this [blog](https://jafarabdi.github.io/blog/2025/ros2-pixi-dev/).

### Scene Configuration

Both Gazebo and MuJoCo load the scene from the SDF world in `pai_description`. Edit [`pai_description/world/so_arm_table.sdf`](../pai_description/world/so_arm_table.sdf) to change the table, tray, or cube positions, then rebuild and relaunch (or relaunch only with symlink-install).

## FAQ

### Warning: "Could not find activation scripts: install/setup.bash"

This warning appears on initial setup because `install/setup.bash` is created by `colcon build`.
It's harmless and will disappear after running `pixi run build`.

### After updating pixi.toml

After modifying `pixi.toml` to add or update dependencies, run `pixi install` to install the new dependencies before building or running tasks.

### Gazebo Warnings and Errors

Common Gazebo-specific warnings and errors that may appear during simulation:

**"Trying to set debug visualization mode while GI is disabled"**: This error occurs when Gazebo's Global Illumination (GI) system tries to set debug visualization before GI is fully initialized.

**"libEGL warning: egl: failed to create dri2 screen"**: This warning appears when Gazebo cannot access the GPU directly.

The simulation will still run using software rendering, but without hardware acceleration.
